Please run test.py for testing

classification.ipynb is the training file, but it has been changed after the best version. So the best result is not guaranteed, and the hyper parameters are not necessarily the best.

Some functions in DataProcessing.py and DataAugment.py are out of date. Since I don't think it is not meaningful to check them in detail, I didn't delete them all. Thus some of them might look weird.

Please contact the author if anything in this repository is confusing.
